# description of code
# I first defined the the celsius to fahrenheit and vice versa conversions to where i can then put them into conditionals
Then, i gave the user an option for their input for either c or f, it will automatically lowercase.
afterwards, i put the defined functions into if conditions stating that if the user inputs the letter c, for celsius print a string with the temperature converted to f, and then the "else" illustrates the opposite with f converting to c.
